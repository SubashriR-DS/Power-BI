# Project Overview
A dynamic, interactive Power BI report designed to explore chocolate product sales performance across regions, sales reps, and order statuses—delivering clear insights into product trends, sales efficiency, and operational outcomes.
# Tech Stack
The dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies:

📊 Power BI Desktop – Core platform for developing interactive data visualizations.

🧹 Power Query – Used for data cleaning, transformation, and preparation.

🧠 DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Custom calculations and performance metrics like average sales per box, delivery rate, etc.

🧩 Data Modeling – Relationships among key data points (salesperson, product, date, country).

📁 File Format – .pbix for development and .xlsx as the input data source.

# Data Source
Source: Internal Sales Log (Excel file: sample-chocolate-sales-data-1.xlsx)

Structure:
Sales Person – Name of the person who made the sale
22 Products – Type of chocolate/candy product sold (e.g., White Choc,  50% Dark Bites)
Country – Country where the sale was made
Date – Transaction date
