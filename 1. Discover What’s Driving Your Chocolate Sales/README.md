# Title of the Dashboard :Global Chocolate Sales Insights Dashboard

# Project Overview
Every chocolate box sold has a story‚Äîabout what people choose, when they buy it, where they live, and who sold it to them.

# In this project, I wanted to answer one key question:
## Which chocolates sell the most, in which places, and why?
We started with a large dataset containing sales records of products like Bubblegum Blitz and 50% Dark Bites. The data included details from different countries, salespeople, and dates. Our goal was to find hidden patterns in all this information.

# Features / Highlights
##  Business Problem
Sales managers lack a unified view of product performance, regional trends, and salesperson contributions. It's also difficult to track delivery consistency and product popularity at a glance.
## Goal of the Dashboard
To provide a centralized and user-friendly dashboard that:
Tracks chocolate sales volume and revenue across countries and time.
Identifies top and underperforming products and salespersons.
## Walkthrough of Key Visuals
 - we built an easy-to-use Power BI dashboard that turns raw data into useful insights.
 - **Line charts** showed how sales go up and down during certain times of the year, like during holidays.
 - **Bar  and donut charts** helped us see which chocolates are most popular and which countries bring in the most money.
 - **Tables** highlighted which salespeople sold the most, so we could recognize top performers or support others.
 - **KPI cards** gave a quick view of the total money made and the number of boxes sold.
 - **A calendar filter (slicer)** let users explore the data by year, quarter, month, or week.

# Tech Stack
The dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies:

üìä Power BI Desktop ‚Äì Core platform for developing interactive data visualizations.

üßπ Power Query ‚Äì Used for data cleaning, transformation, and preparation.

üß† DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) ‚Äì Custom calculations and performance metrics like average sales per box, delivery rate, etc.

üß© Data Modeling ‚Äì Relationships among key data points (salesperson, product, date, country).

üìÅ File Format ‚Äì .pbix for development and .xlsx as the input data source.

# Data Source
Source: Internal Sales Log (Excel file: sample-chocolate-sales-data-1.xlsx)
